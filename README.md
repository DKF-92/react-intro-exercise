React Intro Exercise

This project is just to refresh myself on the basic principles of React

Motivation/Why did you build this project?

Just to serve as a quick and simple way for me to revisit some of the very basic react principles. Sort of a refresher. This will be the first step in a more in depth review of React to re-educate myself on principles learned during freecodecamp.org's React?Redux course.
